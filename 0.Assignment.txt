Investigate Restful Booker API service and create test plan: https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/

1.Write test cases for this service (concentrate on real user flows, potentially combining multiple api calls in one test case)
2.From all the test cases, identify what you think represents a Smoke Test
3.Identify positive and negative test cases
4.With a tool or programming/scripting language (JMeter, Python, Ruby, Java, Javascript...), automate the smoke test from #2 (it is plus if you are using some testing framework in any of the listed programming/scripting languages)
5.Create Github repository and push your assignment solution with the documentation on how to run the automated tests there
6.Report bugs if you find any, with detailed steps to reproduce
