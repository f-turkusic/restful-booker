Test Case: API Smoke Test

Description: Verify the basic functionality of the API endpoints using a minimal set of critical test scenarios.
Precondition: A valid token for authentication is available.
Steps:
Generate a new token using the "Auth" API endpoint.
Call the "Health" API endpoint to check the health of the service.
Verify that the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful health check).
Create a new booking by sending a POST request to the "Booking" API endpoint with minimal valid data (e.g., essential fields like check-in and check-out dates, room details).
Verify that the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful booking).
Retrieve the booking details by sending a GET request to the "Booking/{bookingId}" API endpoint.
Verify that the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful retrieval).
Update the booking details by sending a PUT request to the "Booking/{bookingId}" API endpoint with minimal valid data (e.g., update the check-out date).
Verify that the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful update).
Delete the booking by sending a DELETE request to the "Booking/{bookingId}" API endpoint.
Verify that the response status code is 201 (indicating a successful deletion).
